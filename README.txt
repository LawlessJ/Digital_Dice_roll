				----Digital Dice Roll----
Requires: Python 3.7

This script can be executed from your computer terminal. Navigate to your working directory and enter the command:
>> python3 dice_roll.py
to execute the script.

This program is a simple random number generator. The user if first prompted to select the size of the dice they wish to roll: 6 sided, 8 sided, 12 sided, 20 sided or 24 sided. A random  number within those parameters will be selected. The user can "roll" again as often as they wish. Once they decide not to roll again, they are prompted to either select another sized die if they wish, or quit the program, which ends the script.
